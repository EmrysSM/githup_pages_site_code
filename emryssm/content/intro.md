My name is Emrys, and I love working with, and learning new things. I enjoy being active, whether it's playing soccer, enjoying nature, or hitting the gym. I always make room to take a moment to relax and enjoy life. I am a software developer with over seven years of combined experience in the tech industry. I enjoy leveraging my breadth of tech knowledge, communication capabilities, and leadership. I work with HNTB as a software developer where I work on various GIS, website, and web application projects.
